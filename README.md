# Feature Dataset and Feature Analysis in LSFNet

This repo contains:

- a smaller feature dataset for video classification, which are dense trajectory (DT) features extracted from a subset of iCetanaPrivateDataset,
- jupyter notebooks for a simple analysis of the DT features,
- python codes for fisher vector encoding and 
- a jupyter notebook for the use of fisher score in feature selection.

This repo is for the ICIP2019 paper:

Lei Wang, Du Q. Huynh, and Moussa Reda Mansour, "**Loss Switching Fusion with Similarity Search for Video Classification**," *2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)*, 2019, pp. 974-978, doi: 10.1109/ICIP.2019.8803051.
